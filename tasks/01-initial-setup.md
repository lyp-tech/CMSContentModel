# Initial Project Setup

## Description
Set up the initial project structure and configuration for the CMS Content Model Library.

## Vanilla TypeScript Approach
- No frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Use only vanilla TypeScript/JavaScript
- Leverage SGDS web components for UI
- Framework-agnostic design

## Tasks
- [x] Initialize TypeScript configuration for vanilla JS/TS
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier with SGDS configuration
- [x] Configure build process (ES Modules)
- [ ] Set up testing framework (Web Test Runner)
- [ ] Add documentation for vanilla JS/TS usage
- [ ] Create basic CI/CD pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria
- Project can be built with `npm run build`
- Tests can be run with `npm test`
- Code style is enforced via ESLint and Prettier
- Basic documentation is in place
- CI pipeline is configured for main branch

## Notes
- Follow the Windsurf Rules for smallest possible changes
- Only use approved dependencies
- Keep the setup minimal but complete for development
