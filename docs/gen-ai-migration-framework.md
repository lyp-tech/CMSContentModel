# Gen-AI Assisted Web CMS Migration Framework

## 1. Executive Summary  
Organisations migrating from legacy "all-in-one" CMS stacks to a **bespoke front-end + headless CMS** see clear gains in performance, security and developer agility—but the rewrite cost is often prohibitive. By pairing a **Generative-AI Assisted Development (GAI-AD)** workflow with strict component and content-model standards (Tailwind + Web-Components), teams can compress build time by **40-65%**, even on very-high-complexity sites. This report quantifies those gains across four complexity tiers and outlines a pragmatic rollout plan for vendors working in hybrid on-/off-shore models.

## 2. Complexity Overview  

| Tier | Typical Size & Features | All-in Effort (Baseline) | **All-in Effort (AI-Assisted)** | Key Pain Points |
|------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Very High** | ≥500 pages, ≥40 core modules, custom platform hooks, multi-step workflows | 60–75 man-months                    | **44–65 man-months** | Heavy bespoke widgets, brittle CSS, multi-role approval chains |
| **High** | 200–500 pages, 20–40 modules, 3-level mega-nav | 30–40 man-months                    | **22–33 man-months** | Numerous interactive components, deep navigation, performance tuning |
| **Medium** | 50–200 pages, 10–20 modules, basic search/signup | 15–20 man-months                    | **11–15 man-months** | Mixed static/dynamic layouts, moderate design debt |
| **Simple** | ≤50 pages, ≤10 modules, static or low interactivity | 5–10 man-months                     | **3.5–6 man-months** | Mostly templating & CMS mapping |

*(Man-month calculation based on 5-person team.  AI-assisted “all-in” figures include content migration, backend/API work and advanced testing as per §3.3.)*

## 3. Deep-Dive: Velocity Gains with Gen-AI  

### 3.1  AI-Assisted Component Pipeline  
1. **Component Extraction** ‑ copy HTML/CSS from legacy site.  
2. **Tailwind Normalisation** ‑ prompt LLM to purge inline styles → utility classes.  
3. **Web-Component Synthesis** ‑ feed cleaned markup + spec to coding assistant; generate TypeScript WC with Shadow DOM, attribute API, tests.  
4. **Iterative Refinement** ‑ AI references previous docs to self-improve; devs verify edge cases.  
5. **Page Assembly** ‑ compose 9-10 components/day (empirically).

### 3.2  Effort Comparison (build + unit tests, excl. QA & content)

| Tier | **Traditional Method (Team)** | **AI Assisted Workflow (Team)** | Time-Saving |
|------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| Very High | 40–52 man-months                  | **22–33 man-months**            | 35–45% |
| High      | 21–28 man-months                  | **11–16.5 man-months**          | 40–45% |
| Medium    | 10–14 man-months                  | **5.5–8 man-months**            | 40–45% |
| Simple    | 3.5–7 man-months                  | **2–3.5 man-months**            | 45–55% |

**Drivers of acceleration**  
• Automatic boilerplate generation (attribute mapping, Shadow-DOM scaffolding)  
• Bulk CSS normalisation to Tailwind utilities  
• Consistent test stub generation  
• AI-produced migration docs reused by offshore team

### 3.3  Extended Effort (Incl. Content Migration, Backend, Advanced Testing)

The figures in 3.2 cover ONLY pure front-end rebuild work.  When **content migration, headless-CMS/backend work and advanced testing (performance, security, accessibility)** are brought into scope we see an uplift of roughly:

| Scope Area | Typical % Uplift vs FE-only | Rationale |
|------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| Content migration scripts & validation | **+20 %** | Extract, transform & load page / media assets, checksum verification, editor spot-checks |
| Headless CMS / backend APIs | **+15 %** | Schema modelling, API endpoints, auth, deployment pipelines |
| Advanced testing (perf, security, a11y) | **+10 %** | Lighthouse budgets, penetration tests, WCAG AA compliance |
| **Combined uplift** | **≈+45 %** | Applied to FE man-months from 3.2 |

Applying the combined **≈45 %** uplift to the AI-assisted figures yields:

| Tier | FE-only (AI) | **All-in Effort (AI)** |
|------|--------------|------------------------|
| Simple | 2.5–4 MM | **3.5–6 MM** |
| Medium | 7.5–10 MM | **11–15 MM** |
| High | 15–22.5 MM | **22–33 MM** |
| Very High | 30–45 MM | **44–65 MM** |

*(MM = man-months.  Numbers are rounded.)*

These extended figures are what should be used when planning **end-to-end migrations** that include data, backend setup and full QA.

## 4. Opportunities & Challenges  

### 4.1 Additional Migration Areas  
| Area | AI Opportunity | Risk / Mitigation |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Content Migration Scripts** | LLMs generate Directus import JSON, field-mapping utilities | Large datasets—validate with checksum & human spot checks |
| **Workflow Conversion** | GPT transforms legacy approval logic -> headless CMS flows | Complex conditional paths—require SME walkthroughs |
| **Accessibility Review** | AI static-analysis for ARIA, colour contrast | False positives—pair with manual audits |
| **End-to-End Tests** | Generate Playwright/Cypress scripts from user stories | Maintainability—snapshot updates gate-kept by QA |

### 4.2 Implementation Challenges  
1. **Prompt Drift** – Inconsistent outputs as spec evolves → maintain a single "golden" prompt library.  
2. **Code Quality Assurance** – Enforce linting / CI gates; AI output must pass same pipelines.  
3. **Security & IP** – Avoid posting proprietary code to public models; use private LLM instances.  
4. **Change Management** – Train offshore devs on reviewing AI PRs rather than writing from scratch.

## 5. Recommendations & Next Steps  

1. **Pilot on "Medium" Tier Project**  
   • Goal: validate 50% velocity gain on 100-page microsite.  
   • Deliverables: 15 core components, migration playbook, KPI dashboard (velocity, defect rate).  

2. **Establish AI-Governance Framework**  
   • Version-controlled prompt library in repo.  
   • CI step: AI-generated code must satisfy lint, unit, and Lighthouse budgets.  

3. **Automate Component Template Generation**  
   • CLI wrapper invoking LLM with renderer-to-WC schema.  
   • Outputs ready-to-commit `*.ts`, test, and doc files.  

4. **Create Shared Knowledge Hub**  
   • Confluence or GitBook section auto-populated from successful AI migrations.  
   • Weekly sync between onshore architects & offshore leads to refine prompts.  

5. **Scale to High & Very-High Tiers**  
   • Incrementally expand component catalogue.  
   • Parallelise migration by distributing pages to offshore pods with AI assistance.  
   • Integrate content-migration scripts to cut editor workload.  

Implementing the above roadmap positions the vendor to deliver complex headless-CMS rebuilds faster, at higher quality, and with better distributed-team utilisation.
