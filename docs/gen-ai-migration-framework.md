# Gen-AI Assisted Web CMS Migration Framework

## 1. Executive Summary  
Organisations migrating from legacy "all-in-one" CMS stacks to a **bespoke front-end + headless CMS** see clear gains in performance, security and developer agility—but the rewrite cost is often prohibitive. By pairing a **Generative-AI Assisted Development (GAI-AD)** workflow with strict component and content-model standards (Tailwind + Web-Components), teams can compress build time by **40-65%**, even on very-high-complexity sites. This report quantifies those gains across four complexity tiers and outlines a pragmatic rollout plan for vendors working in hybrid on-/off-shore models.

## 2. Complexity Overview  

| Tier | Typical Size & Features | Baseline Effort (Traditional) | Key Pain Points |
|------|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Very High** | ≥500 pages, ≥40 core modules, custom platform hooks, multi-step workflows | 60–75 man-months | Heavy bespoke widgets, brittle CSS, multi-role approval chains |
| **High** | 200–500 pages, 20–40 modules, 3-level mega-nav | 30–40 man-months | Numerous interactive components, deep navigation, performance tuning |
| **Medium** | 50–200 pages, 10–20 modules, basic search/signup | 15–20 man-months | Mixed static/dynamic layouts, moderate design debt |
| **Simple** | ≤50 pages, ≤10 modules, static or low interactivity | 5–10 man-months | Mostly templating & CMS mapping |

*(Man-month calculation based on 5-person team: 1 product designer + 3 FE devs + 1 BE dev; content migration excluded)*

## 3. Deep-Dive: Velocity Gains with Gen-AI  

### 3.1  AI-Assisted Component Pipeline  
1. **Component Extraction** ‑ copy HTML/CSS from legacy site.  
2. **Tailwind Normalisation** ‑ prompt LLM to purge inline styles → utility classes.  
3. **Web-Component Synthesis** ‑ feed cleaned markup + spec to coding assistant; generate TypeScript WC with Shadow DOM, attribute API, tests.  
4. **Iterative Refinement** ‑ AI references previous docs to self-improve; devs verify edge cases.  
5. **Page Assembly** ‑ compose 9-10 components/day (empirically).

### 3.2  Effort Comparison (build + unit tests, excl. QA & content)

| Tier | Traditional Hand-Code (Team) | GAI-AD Workflow (Team) | Time-Saving |
|------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Very High | 60–75 man-months | **30–45 man-months** | 40–50% |
| High | 30–40 man-months | **15–22.5 man-months** | 45–55% |
| Medium | 15–20 man-months | **7.5–10 man-months** | 50–60% |
| Simple | 5–10 man-months | **2.5–4 man-months** | 60–65% |

**Drivers of acceleration**  
• Automatic boilerplate generation (attribute mapping, Shadow-DOM scaffolding)  
• Bulk CSS normalisation to Tailwind utilities  
• Consistent test stub generation  
• AI-produced migration docs reused by offshore team

## 4. Opportunities & Challenges  

### 4.1 Additional Migration Areas  
| Area | AI Opportunity | Risk / Mitigation |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Content Migration Scripts** | LLMs generate Directus import JSON, field-mapping utilities | Large datasets—validate with checksum & human spot checks |
| **Workflow Conversion** | GPT transforms legacy approval logic -> headless CMS flows | Complex conditional paths—require SME walkthroughs |
| **Accessibility Review** | AI static-analysis for ARIA, colour contrast | False positives—pair with manual audits |
| **End-to-End Tests** | Generate Playwright/Cypress scripts from user stories | Maintainability—snapshot updates gate-kept by QA |

### 4.2 Implementation Challenges  
1. **Prompt Drift** – Inconsistent outputs as spec evolves → maintain a single "golden" prompt library.  
2. **Code Quality Assurance** – Enforce linting / CI gates; AI output must pass same pipelines.  
3. **Security & IP** – Avoid posting proprietary code to public models; use private LLM instances.  
4. **Change Management** – Train offshore devs on reviewing AI PRs rather than writing from scratch.

## 5. Recommendations & Next Steps  

1. **Pilot on "Medium" Tier Project**  
   • Goal: validate 50% velocity gain on 100-page microsite.  
   • Deliverables: 15 core components, migration playbook, KPI dashboard (velocity, defect rate).  

2. **Establish AI-Governance Framework**  
   • Version-controlled prompt library in repo.  
   • CI step: AI-generated code must satisfy lint, unit, and Lighthouse budgets.  

3. **Automate Component Template Generation**  
   • CLI wrapper invoking LLM with renderer-to-WC schema.  
   • Outputs ready-to-commit `*.ts`, test, and doc files.  

4. **Create Shared Knowledge Hub**  
   • Confluence or GitBook section auto-populated from successful AI migrations.  
   • Weekly sync between onshore architects & offshore leads to refine prompts.  

5. **Scale to High & Very-High Tiers**  
   • Incrementally expand component catalogue.  
   • Parallelise migration by distributing pages to offshore pods with AI assistance.  
   • Integrate content-migration scripts to cut editor workload.  

Implementing the above roadmap positions the vendor to deliver complex headless-CMS rebuilds faster, at higher quality, and with better distributed-team utilisation.
